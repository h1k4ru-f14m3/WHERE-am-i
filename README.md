# WHERE (am i)

A barebone top down pixel art RPG game.  
  
This project is written in Python using mainly the pygame library.  
  
This project and source code can be made into a nice story-telling game since this is a barebone project.  

## Getting Started

Since this is a game made in python, there are many ways to start playing this. However, there are 2 ways I recommend.  

### Using Code Editors or IDEs

Whip up the code editor or IDE of your choice and clone the project to the directory you desire. Then, simply run the main.py.  

### Using the terminal

Clone the project into a directory of your choice:  

```plain
git clone https://github.com/h1kru-f14m3/WHERE-am-i.git
```

  
Then, simply run the main.py:  

```plain
python main.py
```

  
If you are on Linux, you might have to create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.  
  
Create a virtual environment and activate it:  

```plain
python3 -m venv 

source /bin/activate
```

  
Install the dependencies:  

```plain
pip install pygame-ce
pip install pytmx
```

  
Run main.py:  

```plain
python3 main.py
```
